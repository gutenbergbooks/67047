Sister

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Sherwood Anderson</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> young artist is a woman, and at evening she comes to talk to me
in my room. She is my sister, but long ago she has forgotten that
and I have forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Neither my sister nor I live in our father’s house, and among all my
brothers and sisters I am conscious only of her. The others have positions
in the city and in the evening go home to the house where my sister and I
once lived. My father is old and his hands tremble. He is not concerned
about me, but my sister who lives alone in a room in a house on North Dearborn
Street has caused him much unhappiness.
</p>

<p>
Into my room in the evening comes my sister and sits upon a low
couch by the door. She sits cross-legged and smokes cigarettes. When
she comes it is always the same—she is embarrassed and I am embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
Since she has been a small girl my sister has always been very strange.
When she was quite young she was awkward and boyish and tore her
clothes climbing trees. It was after that her strangeness began to be noticed.
Day after day she would slip away from the house and go to walk in the
streets. She became a devout student and made such rapid strides in her
classes that my mother—who to tell the truth is fat and uninteresting—spent
the days worrying. My sister, she declared, would end by having
brain fever.
</p>

<p>
When my sister was fifteen years old she announced to the family that
she was about to take a lover. I was away from home at the time, on one
of the wandering trips that have always been a passion with me.
</p>

<p>
My sister came into the house, where the family were seated at the
table, and, standing by the door, said she had decided to spend the night
with a boy of sixteen who was the son of a neighbor.
</p>

<p>
The neighbor boy knew nothing of my sister’s intentions. He was at
home from college, a tall, quiet, blue-eyed fellow, with his mind set upon
foot-ball. To my family my sister explained that she would go to the boy
and tell him of her desires. Her eyes flashed and she stamped with her foot
upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
My father whipped my sister. Taking her by the arm he led her into
the stable at the back of the house. He whipped her with a long black whip
that always stood upright in the whip-socket of the carriage in which, on
Sundays, my mother and father drove about the streets of our suburb. After
the whipping my father was ill.
</p>

<p>
I am wondering how I know so intimately all the details of the whipping
of my sister. Neither my father nor my sister have told me of it. Perhaps
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
sometime, as I sat dreaming in a chair, my mother gossiped of the
whipping. It would be like her to do that, and it is a trick of my mind
never to remember her figure in connection with the things she has told me.
</p>

<p>
After the whipping in the stable my sister was quite changed. The
family sat tense and quiet at the table and when she came into the house
she laughed and went upstairs to her own room. She was very quiet and
well-behaved for several years and when she was twenty-one inherited some
money and went to live alone in the house on North Dearborn Street. I
have a feeling that the walls of our house told me the story of the whipping.
I could never live in the house afterwards and came away at once to this
room where I am now and where my sister comes to visit me.
</p>

<p>
And so there is my sister in my room and we are embarrassed. I do
not look at her but turn my back and begin writing furiously. Presently
she is on the arm of my chair with her arm about my neck.
</p>

<p>
I am the world and my sister is the young artist in the world. I am
afraid the world will destroy her. So furious is my love of her that the
touch of her hand makes me tremble.
</p>

<p>
My sister would not write as I am now writing. How strange it would
seem to see her engaged in anything of the kind. She would never give the
slightest bit of advice to any one. If you were dying and her advice would
save you she would say nothing.
</p>

<p>
My sister is the most wonderful artist in the world, but when she is
with me I do not remember that. When she has talked of her adventures,
up from the chair I spring and go ranting about the room. I am half blind
with anger, thinking perhaps that strange, furtive looking youth, with whom
I saw her walking yesterday in the streets, has had her in his arms. The
flesh of my sister is sacred to me. If anything were to happen to her body
I think I should kill myself in sheer madness.
</p>

<p>
In the evening after my sister is gone I do not try to work any more.
I pull my couch to the opening by the window and lie down. It is then a
little that I begin to understand my sister. She is the artist right to adventure
in the world, to be destroyed in the adventure, if that be necessary, and
I, on my couch, am the worker in the world, blinking up at the stars that
can be seen from my window when my couch is properly arranged.

<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> Thanksgiving Day some five thousand men and women marched
in Joe Hillstrom’s funeral. Why didn’t they march for Joe Hillstrom
before he was shot, everybody is asking.
</p>

<p>
Yes, naturally. Why not?
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, why didn’t some one shoot the governor of Utah before
he could shoot Joe Hill? It might have awakened Capital—<em>and Labor</em>.
Or why didn’t five hundred of the five thousand get Joe Hill out of jail?
It could have been done. Or why didn’t fifty of the five thousand make
a protest that would set the nation gasping?
</p>

<p>
There are Schmidt and Caplan. Why doesn’t some one see to it that
they are released? Labor <em>could</em> do it. And there are the Chicago garment
strikers. Why doesn’t some one arrange for the beating-up of the police
squad? That would make a good beginning. Or set fire to some of the
factories, or start a convincing sabotage in the shops?
</p>

<p>
Why aren’t these things done?
</p>

<p>
For the same reason that men continue to support institutions they no
longer believe in; that women continue to live with men they no longer
love; that youth continues to submit to age it no longer respects; for the
same reason that you are a slave when you want to be free, or a nonentity
when you would like to have a personality.

It is a matter of Spirit. Spirit can do anything. It is the only thing
in the world that can.

The Road to Universal Slaughter

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">E</span><span class="postfirstchar">ver</span> since the beginning of the European conflagration the people of
Europe have thrown themselves into the flames of war like panic-stricken
cattle. And now America, pushed to the very brink by unscrupulous
politicians, by ranting demagogues, and by military sharks, is preparing
for the same terrible feat.
</p>

<p>
In the face of this approaching disaster it behooves men and women
not yet overcome by the war madness to raise their protest, to call the attention
of the people to the crime and outrage which are about to be perpetrated
upon them.
</p>

<p>
America is essentially the melting pot. No national unit composing it
is in a position to boast of superior race purity, particular historic mission,
or higher culture. Yet the jingoes and war speculators are filling the air
with the sentimental slogan of hypocritical nationalism, “America for
Americans,” “America first, last, and all the time.” This cry has caught
the popular fancy from one end of the country to the other. In order to
maintain America military preparedness must be engaged in at once. A
billion dollars of the people’s sweat and blood is to be expended for dreadnaughts
and submarines for the army and the navy, all to protect this precious
America.
</p>

<p>
The pathos of it all is that the America which is to be protected by a
huge military force is not the America of the people, but the America of
the privileged class; the class which robs and exploits the masses, and controls
their lives. And it is no less pathetic that so few people realize that
preparedness never leads to peace, but is indeed the road to universal slaughter.
</p>

<p>
The American military ring with its Roosevelts, its Garrisons, its Daniels,
and lastly its Wilsons, is moving the very heavens to place the militaristic
heel upon the necks of the American people—using the same methods of
the German diplomats to saddle the masses with Prussian militarism. If
it is successful America will be hurled into the storm of blood and tears
now devastating the countries of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Forty years ago Germany proclaimed the slogan: “Germany above
everything. Germany for the Germans, first, last and always. We want
peace; therefore we must prepare for war. Only a well-armed and thoroughly-prepared
nation can maintain peace, can command respect, can be
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
sure of its national integrity.” And Germany continued to prepare, thereby
forcing the other nations to do the same. The European war is the fruition
of the gospel of military preparedness.
</p>

<p>
Since the war began, miles of paper and oceans of ink have been used
to prove the barbarity, the cruelty, the oppression of Prussian militarism.
Conservatives and radicals alike are giving their support to the Allies for
no other reason than to help crush that militarism, in the presence of which,
they say, there can be no peace or progress in Europe. But though America
grows fat on the manufacture of munition and war loans to the Allies
to help crush Prussianism, the same cry is now being raised in America
which, if carried into national action, will build up an American militarism
far more terrible than German or Prussian militarism could ever be; because
nowhere in the world has capitalism become so brazen in its greed
as in America, and nowhere is the state so ready to kneel at the feet of
capital.
</p>

<p>
Like a plague the mad spirit of militarism is sweeping the country, infesting
the clearest heads and staunchest hearts. National security leagues,
with cannon as their emblem of protection, naval leagues with women in
their lead, have sprung up all through the United States. Americanization
societies with well-known liberals as members, they who but yesterday decried
the patriotic clap-trap of today, are now lending themselves to the befogging
of the minds of the people, to the building-up of the same destructive
institutions in America which they are directly and indirectly helping
to pull down in Germany—militarism, the destroyer of youth, the raper
of woman, the annihilator of the best in the race, the very mower of life.
</p>

<p>
Even Woodrow Wilson, who not so long ago talked of “a nation too
proud to fight,” who in the beginning of the war ordered prayers for peace,
who in his proclamations spoke of the necessity of watchful waiting—even
he has been whipped into line. He has now joined his worthy colleagues
in the jingo movement, echoing their clamor for preparedness and their
howl of “America for Americans.” The difference between Wilson and
Roosevelt is this: Roosevelt, the bully, uses the club; Wilson, the historian,
the college professor, wears the smooth polished university mask, but underneath
it he, like Roosevelt, has but one aim: to serve the big interests, to
add to those who are growing phenomenally rich by the manufacture of
military preparedness.
</p>

<p>
Woodrow Wilson, in his address before the Daughters of the American
Revolution, gave his case away when he said: “I would rather be beaten
than ostracized.” To stand out against the Bethlehem, Du Pont, Baldwin,
Remington, Winchester metallic cartridges and the rest of the armament
ring means political ostracism and death. Wilson knows that; therefore
he betrays his original position, goes back on the bombast of “too proud
to fight,” and howls as loudly as any other cheap politician for preparedness
and national glory, for the silly pledge the Navy League women intend
to impose upon every school child: “I pledge myself to do all in my power
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
to further the interests of my country, to uphold its institutions and to
maintain the honor of its name and its flag. As I owe everything in life
to my country, I consecrate my heart, mind, and body to its service and
promise to work for its advancement and security in times of peace and to
shrink from no sacrifice or privation in its cause should I be called upon
to act in its defense for the freedom, peace, and happiness of our people.”
</p>

<p>
To uphold the institutions of our country—that is it; the institutions
which protect and sustain a handful of people in the robbery and plunder
of the masses, the institutions which drain the blood of the native as well
as of the foreigner and turn it into wealth and power; the institutions which
rob the alien of whatever originality he brings with him and in return give
him cheap Americanism, whose glory consists in mediocrity and arrogance.
</p>

<p>
The very proclaimers of “America first” have long before this betrayed
the fundamental principles of real Americanism, of the kind of
Americanism Jefferson had in mind when he said that the best government
is that which governs least; the kind of an America David Thoreau
worked for when he proclaimed that the best government is the one that
doesn’t govern at all; or the other truly great Americans who aimed to make
of this country a haven of refuge, who hoped that all the disinherited and oppressed
coming to these shores would give character, quality and meaning
to the country. That is not the America of the politicians and the munition
speculators. Their America has been powerfully portrayed by a young
New York sculptor I know; he has made a hard cruel hand with long lean
merciless fingers, crushing in over the heart of the foreigner, squeezing out
its blood in order to coin dollars.
</p>

<p>
No doubt Woodrow Wilson has reason to defend these institutions.
But what an ideal to hold out to the young generation! And how is a military-drilled
and trained people to defend freedom, peace, and happiness?
This is what Major General O’Ryan has to say of an efficiently trained
generation: “The soldier must be so trained that he becomes a mere automation;
he must be so trained that it will destroy his initiative; he must be
so trained that he is turned into a machine. The soldier must be forced
into the military noose; he must be jacked up; he must be ruled by his superiors
with pistol in hand.”
</p>

<p>
This was not said by a Prussian Junker; not by a German barbarian;
not by Treitska or Bernhardi, but by an American major general. And he
is right. You cannot conduct war with equals; you cannot have militarism
with free born man; you must have slaves, automatons, machines, obedient
disciplined creatures, who will move, act, shoot, and kill at the command of
their superiors. That is preparedness, and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
It has been reported that among the speakers before the Navy League
was Samuel Gompers. I have long ceased to believe what is reported in the
press. But if that is true, it signalizes the greatest outrage upon labor at
the hands of its own leaders. Preparedness is directed not only against the
external enemy; it aims much more at the internal enemy. It is directed
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
against that element of labor which has learned not to hope for anything
from our institutions, that awakened part of the working people who have
realized that the war of the classes underlies all wars among nations, and
that if war is justified at all it is the war against economic dependence and
political slavery, the two dominant issues involved in the struggle of the
classes.
</p>

<p>
Already militarism has been acting its bloody part in every economic
conflict, with the approval and support of the state. Where was the protest
from Washington when “our men, women and children” were killed in
Ludlow? Where was that high-sounding outraged protest contained in
the note to Germany? Or is there any difference in killing “our men, women
and children” in Ludlow or on the high seas? Yes, indeed. The men,
women, and children at Ludlow were working people, belonging to the disinherited
of the earth, foreigners who had to be given a taste of the glories
of Americanism, while the passengers of the Lusitania represented wealth
and station; therein lies the difference.
</p>

<p>
Preparedness, therefore, will only add to the power of the privileged
few and help them to subdue, to enslave, and crush labor. Surely Gompers
must know that, and if he joins the howl of the military clique he must
stand condemned as a traitor to the cause of labor.
</p>

<p>
It will be with preparedness as it has been with all the other institutions
in our confused life which were created for the good of the people and which
have accomplished the very reverse. Supposedly, America is to prepare for
peace; but in reality it will prepare for the cause of war. It has always
been so and it will continue to be so until nation refuses to fight against
nation, and until the people of the world stop preparing for slaughter. Preparedness
is like the seed of a poisonous plant; placed in the soil, it will bear
poisonous fruit. The European mass destruction is the fruit of that poisonous
seed. It is imperative that the American workers realize this before
they are driven by the jingoes into the madness that is forever haunted by
the spectre of danger and invasion; they must know that to prepare for
peace means to invite war, means to unloose the furies of death over land
and sea.
</p>

<p>
You cannot build up a standing army and then throw it back into a
box like tin soldiers. Armies equipped to the teeth with highly-developed
instruments of murder and backed by their military interests have their own
dynamic functions. We have but to examine into the nature of militarism
to realize the truth of this contention.
</p>

<p>
Militarism consumes the strongest and most productive elements of
each nation. Militarism swallows the largest part of the national revenue.
Even in times of peace almost nothing is spent on education, art, literature,
and science in comparison with the amount devoted to militarism; while in
times of war everything else is set at naught: all life stagnates, all effort
is curtailed, the very sweat and blood of the masses are used to feed this
insatiable monster—militarism. Under such circumstances it must become
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
more arrogant, more aggressive, more bloated with its own importance. If
for no other reason, it is out of surplus energy that militarism must act to
remain alive; therefore it will find an enemy or create one artificially. In
this civilized purpose militarism is sustained by the state, protected by the
laws of the land, fostered by the home and the school, and glorified by public
opinion. In other words, the function of militarism is to kill. It cannot
live except through murder.
</p>

<p>
But the most dominant factor of military preparedness, and the one
which inevitably leads to war, is the creation of group interests which consciously
and deliberately work for the increase of armament whose purposes
are furthered by creating the war hysteria. This group interest embraces
all those engaged in the manufacture and sale of munition and in military
equipment for personal gain and profit. For instance, the family Krupp,
which owns the largest cannon munition plant in the world; its sinister influence
in Germany, and in fact in many other countries, extends to the press,
the school, the church, and to statesmen of highest rank. Shortly before
the war, <a id="corr-0"></a>Karl Liebknecht, the one brave public man in Germany now,
brought to the attention of the Reichstag the fact that the family Krupp had
in its employ officials of the highest military position, not only in Germany,
but in France and in other countries. Everywhere its emissaries have been
at work, systematically inciting national hatreds and antagonisms. The
same investigation brought to light an international war supply trust which
gives a hang for patriotism, or for love of the people, but which uses both
to incite war and to pocket millions of profits out of the terrible bargain.
</p>

<p>
It is not at all unlikely that the history of the present war will trace
its origin to this international murder trust. But is it always necessary for
one generation to wade through oceans of blood and heap up mountains of
human sacrifice that the next generation may learn a grain of truth from it
all? Can we of today not profit by the cause which led to the European
war, can we not learn that it was preparedness, thorough and efficient preparedness
on the part of Germany and the other countries for military aggrandizement
and material gain; above all can we not realize that preparedness
in America must and will lead to the same result, the same barbarity,
the same senseless sacrifice of life? Is America to follow suit, is it to be
turned over to the American Krupps, the American military cliques? It
almost seems so when one hears the jingo howls of the press, the blood and
thunder tirades of bully Roosevelt, the sentimental twaddle of our college-bred
President.
</p>

<p>
The more reason for those who still have a spark of libertarianism and
humanity left to cry out against this great crime, against the outrage now
being prepared and imposed upon the American people. It is not enough
to claim being neutral; a neutrality which sheds crocodile tears with one
eye and keeps the other riveted upon the profits from war supplies and war
loans, is not neutrality. It is merely hypocritical. Nor is it enough to join
the bourgeois pacifists, who proclaim peace among the nations, while helping
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
to perpetuate the war among the classes, a war which in reality is at
the bottom of all other wars.
</p>

<p>
It is this war of the classes that we must concentrate upon, and in that
connection the war against false values, against evil institutions, against
all social atrocities. Those who appreciate the urgent need of cooperating
in great struggles must oppose military preparedness imposed by the state
and capitalism for the destruction of the masses. They must organize the
preparedness of the masses for the overthrow of both capitalism and the
state. Industrial and economic preparedness is what the workers need.
That alone leads to revolution at the bottom as against mass destruction
from on top. That alone leads to true internationalism of labor against
Kaiserdom, kingdom, diplomacies, military cliques, and bureaucracies. That
alone will give the people the means to take their children out of the slums,
out of the sweat-shops and the cotton-mills; that alone will enable them to
inculcate in the coming generation a new ideal of brotherhood, to rear them
in play and song and beauty; to bring up men and women, not automatons;
that alone will enable woman to become the real mother of the race, to give
to the world creative men, and not soldiers who destroy. That alone leads
to economic and social freedom, and does away with war.

    <p class="verse">A continent.</p>
    <p class="verse">Her dress was rusty black</p>
    <p class="verse">And scant,</p>
    <p class="verse">Her hat, a melancholy jumble of basement counter bargains.</p>
    <p class="verse">Her sullen eyes,</p>

    <p class="verse">An insatiate greediness for something out of reach;</p>
    <p class="verse">And yet she seemed enwrapped</p>

    <p class="verse">The last day Ellie came</p>
    <p class="verse">Her calm was gone, she had been crying.</p>
    <p class="verse">Fat people never ought to cry;</p>
    <p class="verse">It’s awful....</p>
    <p class="verse">The hot drops fell upon my hand</p>
    <p class="verse">While Ellie dropped the scissors suddenly</p>

    <p class="verse">I said the usual things;</p>
    <p class="verse">I would have patted her but for the grease,</p>

    <p class="verse">Not until the storm was spent</p>
    <p class="verse">And only little catching breaths were left</p>

... Out of the effervescent hurricane of light burst forth a terrible
song.
</p>

<p>
Despair, as if thousands of graves had torn open. As if the heavens
had rent asunder, and the Son of Man had descended upon the earth to
judge the good and the wicked. Millions of hands rose up to heaven in
a mad horror of death—hands that prayed for mercy and charity. He
heard a beastly roar, which like a geyser of a smoking sea of blood spurtled
upward; and above all this he saw bony fingers that twisted and writhed
in convulsions of fear and shouted to heaven: “Ad te clamamus exules filii
Hevae, ad te <a id="corr-3"></a>suspiramus gementes et flentes.”
</p>

<p>
And he saw a multitudinous crowd that was lashed with an insane
ecstacy of destruction, and above them a heaven that yawned with disease
and fire. He saw how those miserable creatures wriggled and serpentined
in hellish madnesses of life; he saw the bleeding backs furrowed by the
whips into chunks; he saw all humanity demented, obsessed, with an
inspired frenzy in the bestialized eyes.
</p>

<p>
Slowly disappeared the procession of the doomed; wild cries intoxicated
with despair died away in a death-rattle, and a sun, red like copper,
shed a chatoyant green light on the <a id="corr-4"></a>puddles of blood.
</p>

<p>
“Ad te clamamus exules filii Hevae!”
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
This is a fragment from an early poem of Przybyszewski, <em>De Profundis</em>.
It is a proper background to all the works of the Pole, to his plays, essays,
novels, poems. At least I see him in that light.
</p>

<p>
A reminiscence: On a rainy autumn night I went to hear him lecture.
“... and if the psychologists will find contradictions in my words—I
shall not feel dismayed. There are contradictions that are dearer to
me than most perfect consequentialities.” From the dim light of the platform
ached a face distorted with contempt and suffering, with the grim
clairvoyance of the Beyond. At moments the eyebrows leaped up and
bulged the forehead into thick, strained furrows, and the eyes suddenly
burst in a flash that revealed unknown worlds, twisting your soul with
awe and mystery. But soon the flame would extinguish, and the face
would resume the masque of contemptuous weariness; the mouth-corners
congealed a satanic would-be smile that prepared one for his famous “Heh-heh.”
That face haunted me for many days and nights, as if my inner
vision had been scalded by an unearthly chimera. My friends, who have
seen his exaggerated portrait painted by Krzyzanowski, will understand
me. Those who will read his works (if they are translated), will understand
me. <em>Homo Sapiens</em><a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a> is but a nuance of his multiplex creative spirit,
though perhaps a most characteristic nuance. Przybyszewski, like Nietzsche,
like Wilde, is a unique mosaique, in which the personality, the artist, his
life and his works, are inseparable, indivisible units of the wonderful whole.
Who can fathom this hellish cosmos, this mare tenebrarum of the modern
man’s soul, which the mad Pole has traversed and penetrated to the bottom,
and has cast out shrieking monsters and gargoyles illuminated with blinding,
dazzling, infernal flames?
</p>

<p>
I cannot. Perhaps only pale glimpses of reflections.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Those who have heard Przybyszewski play Chopin tell us that no virtuoso
can compare with his creative interpretation of his melancholy compatriot.
In his profound essay on <em>Chopin and Nietzsche</em> I have been impressed
not so much with the morbid theory as with the characteristic feature
present in all his work—the reflection of his own personality. In his favorite
artists, in his heroes, in his women, he has painfully sought an expression
of his restless, boundless self. Thus Chopin becomes one of the numerous
selves of Przybyszewski. Let me picture the Composer in the light of the
Poet.
</p>

<p>
Specifically Slavic features: extreme subtility of feeling, easy excitability,
passionateness and sensuousness, predilection for luxury and extravagance,
and, chief of all, a peculiar melancholy lyricism, which is nothing
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
but the expression of the most exalted egoism, whose sole and highest criterion
is his own “I.” These, and the profound melancholy of his native
limitless plains with their desolate sandy expanses, with the lead-skies over
them, have been influences keenly contradicting his flexible, light vivaciousness
of the Gallic, his coquettish effeminacy, his love for life and light.
</p>

<p>
Subtracting the last two strokes, who is it: Chopin or Przybyszewski?
</p>

<p>
The trait most obviously common to both Poles is the unquenchable
yearning, the eternal Sehnsucht, which filters through all their productions.
In neither of them was it the yearning of healthy natures, in whom, as in a
mother’s womb, it bears the embryo of fruitful life; it is not the yearning
of Zarathustra “in a sunny rapture of ecstacy greeting new, unknown gods
with an exalted ‘Evoi’!” Chopin’s longing, as reflected in Przybyszewski,
is tinted with the pale color of anemia peculiar to a representative of a
degenerate aristocracy (the Poet’s progenitor died of delirium tremens),
with his transparent skin projecting the tiniest veins, with his slender figure
and prolongated limbs that breathe with each movement incomparable gracefulness,
with his overdeveloped intellect which shines in his eyes, as in the
eyes of frail children who are doomed to early death. This longing is the
incessant palpitation of a nervous, over-delicate nature, something akin to
the constant irritability of open wounds, the continuous change of ebbs and
flows of morbid sensitiveness, the eternal dissatisfaction of acute emotions,
the fatigableness of a too-susceptible spirit, the weariness of one oversatiated
with suffering. Yet this longing has in it also wild passion, “the convulsive
agony of deadly horror,” self-damnation and thirst for destruction, delirium
and madness of one who strains his gaze into the vast—and sees nothing.
</p>

<p>
Indeed I should like to hear Chopin’s <em>Preludes</em> recreated under the longing
fingers of Stanislaw.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Stanislaw Przybyszewski. Do pronounce it correctly, that you may
hear the sound of rain swishing through tall grass. Przybyszewski has
come to know himself so thoroughly and unreservedly, and, in himself, to
know the modern man of the widest intellectual and artistic horizons, through
a long excruciating internal purgatory. From the study of architecture and
general aesthetics his restless, ever-searching spirit hurled him into natural
sciences in the hope of finding positive answers to his burning questions. He
came out loaded with an enormous baggage of facts and information; yet
he had not quenched his everlasting dissatisfaction, but had acquired a
sceptical “heh-heh” towards life and knowledge. He plunged into psychology,
and found Nietzsche—to him the deepest searcher, possessor of the
keen eye of a degenerate, which like a wintersun sheds its light with morbid
intensity upon snowfields, clearly illuminating each crystal. With a “heh-heh”
he dismissed the Loneliest One. For was not Nietzsche driven to create
for himself a superman, as a consolation, as a hope, as “a soft pillow
upon which could rest his weary inflamed head”? Did he for one moment
believe in that ghost which he erected in the heavy hours of despair? Nonsense.
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
Heh-heh. Had not his Falk, his homo sapiens, been crushed in his
struggle to attain liberation and supermanship? Recall Falk’s self-rending
meditations: “Conscience! Heh-heh-heh! Conscience! How ridiculously
silly is your superman! Herr Professor Nietzsche left out of account tradition
and culture which created conscience in the course of hundreds of
centuries.... Oh, how ridiculous is your superman sans conscience!”
Thus, step after step, killing god after god, burning his ships behind him,
the all-knowing, the all-denying degenerate-nobleman Slav-cosmopolite has
ascended the loftiest summit, or, as he would rather say, has descended into
deepest hell—Art. An equipment hardly appropriate for an artist who sees
“Life Itself” in color and fragrance and petals and varicolored mornings and
varicolored nights and Japanese prints and ... but you may find the catalogue
in the Editor’s rhapsody of last month. Przybyszewski’s background
served him as an Archimedean lever to gauge and fathom the soul of
modernity.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Let me attempt to present the quintessence of Przybyszewski’s modern
Individuum, as he prefers to call an exceptional personality.
</p>

<p>
He considers himself a superman, aloof from the market-interests of
the crowd. He is conscious of the fetters of his instincts and of the gradual
sapping of his strength—hence the history of the Individuum turns into a
sad monography of suppressed will and distorted instincts, a history of a
mountain torrent which cannot find an outlet, and rushes into depth, dissolving
obstructing strata, destroying and washing them away, and ruining
the structure of the rocks in their very bowels.
</p>

<p>
Hence the longing for liberation and the yearning for expanse, a perilous
“palpitating Sehnsucht and craving of the heights, of the beyond.” But
this longing has another distinctive symptom: the consciousness of its hopelessness,
the clear conviction that the passionately-desired goal is but an idée
fixe. In this longing is expressed a spirit that ruins everything in itself with
the corrosive acid of reason, a spirit that had long lost faith in itself, that
considers its own activity diffidently and critically, a spirit that spies and
searches itself, that has lost the faculty of taking itself seriously, that has
become accustomed to mock itself and to play with its own manifestations
as with a ball; a spirit not satisfied with the highest and finest human perceptions,
that has come at last, after many searchings, to the gloomy decision
that all is in vain, that it is incapable of surpassing itself.
</p>

<p>
Hence the pursuit of enjoyment. But this morbid seeking of enjoyment
lacks that direct, self-sufficient bliss that results from the accumulated surplus
of productive strength. The modern Individuum is deprived of that
healthy instinct, therefore in place of naive joy experienced from the liberation
of surcharged power he plunges into self-forgetfulness. All his life
is reduced to pure self-narcotization. In the morbid straining of his abnormally-functioning
nerves the Individuum-decadent rises to those mysterious
borders where the joy and the pain of human existence pass into one another
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
and intermingle, where the two are brought in their extreme manifestations
to a peculiar feeling of destructive rapture, to an ecstatic being outside and
above himself. All his thoughts and acts acquire a character of something
devastating, maniacal, and over all of them reigns a heavy, depressing,
wearying atmosphere, like the one before the outbreak of a storm, something
akin to the passionate tremor of delirious impotence, something similar
to the consumptive flush of spiritual hysteria.
</p>

<p>
In such clinical terms Przybyszewski sees the modern homo sapiens.
Through this prism I perceive his Falk, doomed to utter failure and futility.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Falk an erotomaniac? Nonsense. His sexual relations are as pathological
as the functions of his other faculties, not more. In his incessant search
for an outlet, for discharge, for some quantity that might fill up his hollowed
heart, Falk grasps woman as a potentional complement to his emptiness.
He fails, naturally. To the artist woman is a narcotizer and wing-clipper;
more often a Dalila or Xantippe than a Cosima Wagner or a Clara
Schumann. Neither the exoticism of Ysa, nor the pillow-serviceability of
Yanina, nor the medieval fanaticism of Marit, nor Olga’s revolutionary
resignedness, have the power of checking the hurricane of his questing spirit
for more than a moment, such moments when the tormented man erects for
his consolation a phantom, be it a superman or a Christ. Falk’s quest for
self-forgetfulness is futile. He lacks the healthy capacity of us, normal
beings, for finding salvation in befogging our vision. No matter how we
may indulge in self-analization, we usually stop at the perilous point and
brake our searching demon with the same happy instinct that closes our eyes
automatically at the approach of danger. Falk’s mental motor has no
brakes; it hurls him into the precipice.
</p>

<p>
“I have never suffered on account of a woman,” boasts the old rake,
Iltis.
</p>

<p>
“Because your organism is very tough, a peasant’s organism, my dear
Iltis. Your sensibilities have not yet reached the stage of dependence upon
the brain. You are like a hydromedusa which suddenly parts with its feelers
stocked with sexual organs and sends them off to seek the female, and then
does not bother about them any more. You are a very happy creature, my
dear Iltis. But I don’t envy you your happiness. I never envy the ox his
enjoyment of grass, not even when I am starving.”
</p>

<p>
Przybyszewski’s Individuum seeks in woman the miraculous expression
of his most intimate, most precious “I.” He speaks in one place about the
love of the “anointed artist,” which is a painful conception of an awful unknown
force that casts two souls together striving to link them into one;
an intense torment rending the soul in the impossible endeavor to realize the
New Covenant, the union of two beings, a matter of absolute androgynism.
For such an artist love is “the consciousness of a terrible abyss, the sense of
a bottomless Sheol in his soul, where rages the life of thousands of generations,
of thousands of ages, of their torments and pangs of reproduction and
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
of greed for life.” Now recall Falk’s dream:
</p>

“He saw a meadow-clearing in his father’s forest. Two elks were fighting.
They struck at each other with their large horns, separated, and made
another terrific lunge. Their horns interlocked. In great leaps they tried
to disentangle themselves, turning round and round. There was a crunching
of horns. One elk succeeded in freeing himself and ran his horns into the
other’s breast. He drove them in deeper and deeper, tore ferociously at his
flesh and entrails. The blood spurted.... And near the fighting animals
a female elk was pasturing unmindful of the savage struggle of the passion-mad
males.... In the centre stood the victor trembling and gory, yet
proud and mighty. On his horns hung the entrails of his rival.”

<p class="noindent">
“I don’t envy the ox his enjoyment.” Przybyszewski despises happiness
as something unworthy of an artist. A happy soul, he believes, is a miracle,
the squareness of a circle, a whip made of sand. The soul is sombre, stormy,
for it is the aching of passion and the madness of sweeps, living over ecstacies
of boiling desire, the stupendous anxiety of depths and the boundless
suffering of being. For the artist who creates the world not with his brain,
but with his soul, all life is one “sale corvée,” a filthy burden, eternal horror,
despair, and submission, fruitless struggle and impotent stumbling. For this
reason love, the greatest happiness for ordinary males, becomes for the artist
the profoundest disastrous suffering.
</p>

<p>
Take away from Przybyszewski his ecstacy of pain, and you rob him of
his very essence, of his raison d’être, of his creative breath. When you read
his <em>Poems in Prose</em> you face a soul writhing in hopeless despair, in futile
longing, in maddening convulsions. But you cannot pity the artist. You are
aware of the sublime joy in his sorrow, of the unearthly bliss that is wrapped
in the black wings of his melancholy. In his poem <em>At the Sea</em>, the elemental
yearning of his soul reaches cosmic dimensions. Only one other poem approaches
it in its surcharged grief—Ben Hecht’s <em>Night-Song</em>, if we overlook
the latter’s redundancy. Allow me to give you a pale translation of the
“Introibo” to <em>At the Sea</em>:—may the Pole’s spirit forgive me my sacrilegious
impertinence.

Thou, who with ray-clad hands wreathest my dreams with
the beauty of fading autumn, with the splendor of off-blooming
grandeur, with inflamed hues of the burning paradise,—
</p>

<p>
Radiant mine!
</p>

<p>
How many pangs have passed as if in a dream, since I saw
Thee for the last time, and yet mine heart doth shine amidst the
stars which Thou hast strewn in my life, yet the thirsting hands
of my blood yearn for the bliss Thou didst once kindle in my soul.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
Thou, who in evening twilight spinnest for me with still
hands on enchanted harps heavy meditation on moments of joy
that have flown away like a distant whisper of leaves,—on suns
that, sinking into the sea, sparkle in the east with bloody dew,—on
nights that press to their warm breast tortured hearts,—
</p>

<p>
Radiant mine!
</p>

<p>
How many times has the sun set since those hours when with
Thy magic songs Thou pacified the sorrow of my soul,—and
yet I see Thine eyes, full of moans and sadness, burning in an
unearthly rapture, see the radiant hand stretching towards me
and grasping mine with a hot cry.
</p>

<p>
Thou, who transformest stormy nights into sunny days, in
the depths of my dreams quenchest reality, removest into an infinite

bearest unto life black flowers—

A thousand times has the world transfigured since Thy look
consumed the tarnishing glitter of my soul, and yet I see Thy
little child-like face and the golden crown of hair over Thy brow,
see how two tears had spread into a pale smile that glowed on
Thy mouth, and hear the dark plaint of Thy voice.
</p>

<p>
Thou, who breakest before me the seals of all mysteries and
readest the runes of hidden powers, and in all the madnesses of
my life flingest Thyself in a rainbow of blessing from one heaven

“Homo Sapiens” Discussed by Readers
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
In another place I called <em>Homo Sapiens</em> “the book of the age.” Surely
there has not been a more stirring work of literature since <em>Werther</em>. Will
the public respond? Is it true that the wall of American indifferentism is
impregnable? I am still optimistic about the intellectual aristocracy of
this country; that small circle of the young in spirit, brave searchers and
earnest livers, for whom art and life are not merely diversions between meals
and business transactions, but the italicized essence of existence. To those
few Przybyszewski’s book should appeal; those should react.
</p>

<p>
I have been getting curious, and at times interesting, opinions of such
readers. I hope to receive more, and acquaint the <em>Little Review</em> family with
them. On the whole, there prevails a note of depression and uneasiness.
One writes: “I had hoped to be left alone on a mountain peak in a blaze
of light and in the stress of wind; instead there is a sardonic laugh, and I
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
am again hurled into the maelstrom of a world that cannot rise above suffering
from its own passions.” A feminist remarks sadly that the book
demonstrates “the limit of man’s penetration. The women are women still—not
even women of the transition.” An incurable, hopelessly struggling
Puritan rages and curses both me and the author; I give a few gems: “I’ve
read your devilishly wonderful book!... It did many things to me,
which, thank God, have passed like a drunken dream.... For three
days I’ve been hideously torn up, slashed into tatters, savage and fundamental.
But you want my opinion! How can I tell you, divorce it from
myself, tear it out of my living flesh, when it has become imbedded. That
terrible, wonderful Falk! It makes you shudder away from all temperamental
people with experimental souls in their fingers, and few convictions....
I became paralyzed with horror. At last I cried out, writhed on the
floor and prayed to some Power, any Power, for pity, not to see myself,
not to see life beneath the superficial surface.... Go away, take your
Slav fingers out of my soul! They force me to look at truth, when I want
to deal in lies. They force me to climb the heights and peer into the hideous
crevasses, when I want to browse fatuously on the hillocks.” More such
“drunken dreams,” and the comfortable blinders will fall off the eyes of the
happiness-by-all-means-fiends.
</p>

<p>
I submit two letters of friends who have read my article and wished to
supplement my views. I humbly think that what they say is included in my
“reflections”; but I am also conscious of my inherent fault—conciseness
which borders on obscurity. Hence clarification is gratefully welcome.

<p class="noindent">
What you say about Przybyszewski I also think. But what you do not
say about <em>Homo Sapiens</em> is what I feel most of all. There is something very
definite about <em>Homo Sapiens</em>, the book. It rises out of the mass of flaming
gibberish, dissected nerves, and poetical slashings. It rings in the ears long
after the book is closed. It is the most poignant cry of the dying nineteenth
century, and it comes out of lower depths than the cry of Dostoevsky’s Raskolnikov,—shriller,
madder, and more penetrating....
</p>

<p>
Eric Falk is not a nuance. He is the whole of Stanislaw Przybyszewski,
the whole of modern wisdom and introspection, which is another word for
degeneracy.
</p>

<p>
Come now, pretend I am not reviewing it. Pretend I am something
of a clairvoyant.
</p>

<p>
See Przybyszewski creating him—Erick Falk. He is sitting at his
desk. He is going to write a book about man, not a type, not a silhouette,
but about Man complete. He wants the final man of his day, the Homo
Sapiens, the Zarathustran phantom.
</p>

<p>
This Przybyszewski is a thorough fellow, a biologist, a poet, a physician,
an historian, a psychologist. He lives on an operating table. Knows his own
insides.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
“Come here, Zarathustra,” chuckles this Przybyszewski, and he coaxes
him off the heights, off the peaks where he is waiting to be fed by the eagles.
</p>

<p>
And striding from the peaks comes Zarathustra. Who do you suppose
it is? Przybyszewski, of course.
</p>

<p>
They greet each other.
</p>

<p>
And Przybyszewski says to this self of his: “So you are the ultimate
clay, ha, ha.”
</p>

<p>
And this self answers: “Yea, behold in me the finite evolution, man
crowned by his own hard and subtly-won glories.”
</p>

<p>
“Come here,” purrs Przybyszewski. Remember, he is talking to himself—at
his desk.
</p>

<p>
Hesitating, frowning, and yet with the pure grimace of superiority
stamped on his face, this self approaches. And the book is on.
</p>

<p>
Przybyszewski’s inspiration is the fury of a madman, the derisive, diabolical
chuckling of a fanatical cynic.
</p>

<p>
“Come now, we will fly,” whispers Przybyszewski, and off they go—the
innocent Zarathustra and the steeped, slashbuckling Przybyszewski. And
remember still—they are one.
</p>

<p>
And the rest of it is the plot of <em>Homo Sapiens</em>, the book, which I will
skip....
</p>

<p>
Thus Eric Falk soars and Przybyszewski shows the sorry mechanics of
his wings, laughing, chuckling, for they are his own. Thus toward the middle
of the book you begin wondering. Falk is going to pieces, Falk the
immutable, the all knowing, the transcender, the ... the ... the
... the Homo Sapiens. What is the matter? When he betrays a woman
and causes her death a hideous vapor suddenly envelopes his soul and befouls
it. Przybyszewski thrusts his radiant leer from behind Zarathustra’s
mask and hisses, “Conscience, ha!”
</p>

<p>
And thus it goes its merry way. To the edge of the precipice this mad
Pole pushes his whirling Falk, to the utter edge of known reason, known
psychology and known Passions.
</p>

<p>
And then suddenly the soarer falls. The mechanism comes clattering
to earth—to the bottom of the precipice. The lugubrious Stanislaw has led
his creation—himself—to the limits.
</p>

<p>
He has finished his book.
</p>

<p>
Piled on the desk lies the heap of glowing sentences, the history of
rhapsodic vivisection.
</p>

<p>
Przybyszewski has expressed himself.
</p>

<p>
He has uttered his most internal cry, the cry of a poet, a weaver of
plots, an anatomical expert, of an introspective vulture-minded Disbeliever.
</p>

<p>
And now I call your attention to Mr. Przybyszewski at his desk—too
tired to rise. Gone are the golden thrills that quivered in him, gone everything
but the thin sardonic grin that lights the face of Eric Falk—on the
last page. And only Eric Falk’s last cry, “Vive L’Humanité” is left him.
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
So our Stanislaw, the idol of Bohemia, the tortured demon, sits chuckling, a
glass of cognac trembling in his fingers.
</p>

<p>
“Homo Sapiens,” he sighs with his inevitable sneer, that pierces through
his pity and pain like the point of a rapier, “behold thyself. Thou, Eric, art
man. Thou art the creaking vehicle for the golden theories, the rainbow fantasies
which have sifted out of the mental mists of the century. And behold,
thou creakest, thou groanest, thou breakest under this lightest of burdens.”
</p>

<p>
The tired Przybyszewski quivers. His lips, mocking their way through
the delirious poison of thought and passion have kissed the intangible. He
has stripped his brain to its last cell and looked at it. And the cry that rises
out of the book comes condensed from his lips now—after it is done. Nowhere
is it written, nowhere is it heard except at Stanislaw Przybyszewski’s
desk—in Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
It is the answer, ha. Is it?
</p>

<p>
“Homo Sapiens, thou art clay. Thy mind is a super-chaos. Thy soul is
a petty mirage.”
</p>

<h4 class="subsection" id="II7">
II.
</h4>

<p class="noindent">
Przybyszewski transplants his readers from their ordinary mental environment
into those astral regions where metaphysical subtleties are clothed
with reality. Life is dealt with not on the surface strata of its expressions
but at its base where motives and ideas and emotions have their source. And
in spite of this fact, or rather because of the uncanny clairvoyance of its
author there is no perversion or befogging of one’s point of view. These
nebulous regions are lit up by the ruthless penetration of an artist who is
a scientist as well.
</p>

<p>
One’s first sensations are like seeing for the first time with the naked
eye the fan of nerves which spread out from the corona radiata, or touching
the single nerve trunks with the dissecting knife. In the same manner
the pathological Pole brings you into actual contact with the cargos of
these nerves, ideas, emotions, sensations. All the concealing layers of evasions
and of equivocations have been dissected away; there lies spread out
before you sections of naked consciousness. And so subtle has been the dissecting
work that there has been no disarrangement and no death. All is
still living, still functioning. And your sensation of strangeness, almost of
horror, is born out of revulsion against a self-consciousness so intense as
to seem almost morbid. “I feel,” said a friend of mine, “as if I had been
vivisected.” Not so much this as that one has been vivisecting. Przybyszewski
compels you to co-operate with him in analysing psychological phenomena.
At moments you lift your eyes from the page, panting, almost
physically exhausted from the effort of concentrating on those tortuous,
subtle reactions which occur in the farthest recesses of consciousness and
spread upward in waves to the surface, where they often take on curious
irrelevant expression.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
But that is sheer morbidity, cries your friend the Philistine. It is introspection
carried past the point of decency. But to the investigator there
is no point past which it is indecent to press. In him there is no affectation
of scruple to erect its artificial barricade. He must have transcended
all such petty egotism and have depersonalized himself. He is constrained
to this by that curiosity which is his master passion, which generates itself
and is dynamic in him as hunger or sex are dynamic in the ordinary individual.
This curiosity of the artist brooks no bounds, short of the facts
against which it brings up abruptly. And so Przybyszewski for all his uncanny
subtlety cannot be accused of morbidity since he uses it not to distort
but merely to reveal the truth. If he has no false reverence neither has
he irreverence. His scalpel, always flashing and leaping, pauses a moment
on a state of emotion and, pointing, calls it by name. “For I am I,” says
Falk. “I am a criminal diabolic nature.” Or again:
</p>

<p>
“And so a certain man is suffering from love induced by auto-suggestion.
Very well. But at the same time he loves his wife unqualifiedly. And
he loves her so much that there can be no doubt of the reality of his love.
In a word he loves both the one and the other.”
</p>

<p>
But such a condition isn’t possible, the Philistine will cry out, wounded
at his most vulnerable point, his inflexible principles. “A man can’t love two
women at the same time.” This isolated case would undermine the whole
monogamistic theory. He sees one of his cherished institutions tottering.
And so he takes fright and refutes the fact. “It can’t be, it isn’t possible.”
But Przybyszewski continues to stand with the scalpel wearily pointing.
“My dear Sir, this is no question of postulates, it’s a question of an individual
instance. It <em>is</em> possible, because it occurs. Falk <em>does</em> love two women
at the same moment.” And the Philistine will doubtless turn away snorting
furiously and unconvinced. “Przybyszewski,” he will sneer, “that degenerate
Pole, always half drunk with cognac, a Slav to boot. What does he
know of life or reality? They were all neurasthenics. Look at Artzibashev
and Andreyev and Dostoevsky. Yes, let us look at them, and remembering
Dostoevsky’s epilepsy, remember also Raskolnikov. A criminal’s psychology
lifted onto paper out of the limbo regions of consciousness by the mammoth
Russian’s bloody pen. Something more than neurasthenia, this gift of
analysis.
</p>

<p>
What, finally, is Homo Sapiens? Who is this <a id="corr-10"></a>writer-fellow, Falk, with
no conscience, with his “criminal, diabolic nature?” Does he only exist to
analyse himself, and his tortuous, painful psychologizings? Why is he,
what is he?—He is the self-conscious man, par excellence. This book is
the epic of consciousness. “The thing must be thought out,” says Falk.
And nuance by nuance it is thought out, rapidly but faithfully, under your
very eyes. You are invited,—no, compelled,—to take part in the operation.
Hence your feeling of fatigue. And again, after a page or two, “He examined
his own feelings.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
“But why a Falk?” the Philistine demands. “Falk is no average man.
He is a genius, and as such his psychology is specialized and distinct. Falk
is a neurasthenic, victim of erotomania. Even his lucidity is not to his credit.
Since he is a writer it is implicit in him, as muscle is in the circus rider.
He is bound to analyse his acts, to trace them back to their motives. Falk
presents an isolated case. If one is going to deal with consciousness why
not choose a less precocious exponent? Why not the everyday consciousness
of the average human being?”
</p>

<p>
And by the same token, why not a Falk, Mr. Philistine, since we are
agreed that this is a drama of consciousness. Of what use is the average
man in this extremity? The artist is the Homo Sapiens par excellence, for
it is in him that consciousness has reached its most complex differentiation.
“I am,” says Falk, “what they call a highly differentiated individual. I
have, combined in me, everything—design, ambition, sincerity of knowledge
and ignorance, falsehood and truth. A thousand heavens, a thousand
worlds are in me.” And recognizing this fact he wrestles with it through
some four hundred odd pages. That Falk loved two women, or ten women,
is not only possible, but probably inevitable. What in the average man
is a temperate reaching out for a few specific joys becomes in a Falk the
impulse of his whole being for self-expression. It bursts out along a thousand
channels, requiring as many outward aspects as there are sources in
his personality. And it is this devious stream of a human consciousness
that we are following outward to its expression in words or acts, and backward
to its source, as we dissect with Przybyszewski Falk’s mental protoplasm.
</p>

<p>
“Futile,” sneers the Philistine, “utterly futile. If that is a Homo
Sapiens, give me a subman. Your Falk knew no happiness and he gave
none. He only strewed suffering in his wake both for himself and others.
He was without scruples and without conscience. Where did he get to
with all his differentiation? He wrote a few books, to be sure, but what
were they in the scale of the women he ruined, the men he did to death?
Even of his own misery? His gift of introspection was a sharp knife turned
against himself, since he cried out in the end: ‘to be chemically purified of
all thoughts.’ Homo Sapiens indeed!”
</p>

<p>
You can see Przybyszewski wearily twisting the scalpel in his nerveless
hands, you can see the smile that twists his lips just before they curve
about the waiting cognac glass. “No, he was not happy, it is true he did
strew misery in his wake. He was neurasthenic and degenerate and criminal.
He was all these things and all the other things which you have forgotten
or never perceived. For he was Homo Sapiens. And such as he is
I have drawn him. Ha, ha—Vive l’Humanité!”

<p class="dir">
A prosperous First Church in the heart of a great city. Outside the
city’s principle avenue, along which busses and vehicles of all descriptions
are rolling. Surrounding the church a graveyard, heavily shaded with trees,
the branches of which reach to the open windows bearing soft odours. Over
the graves many full blown blossoms, and in the sky a full May moon. An
idling sense of spring in the gait and gestures of the pedestrians. In front
of the church hangs a small lighted cross, and under it swings the sign
“Organ Recital, 8:30, Wilmuth Tabor, Organist.” The doors giving into
the church are open. The interior, save for the presence of a caretaker in
a chair, is empty. On either side of the pulpit, below a great dark rose window,
burns a partially lighted electrolier. In the organ loft, over the street
doors, a single light.

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Organist</span> (<span class="dir">dreamily</span>). This passage always makes me think of
moonlight on open fields and the spicy damp breath of a dark dewy wood,
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
and of lilacs blowing over a wall, too. So suitable, but I would rather live

this—
</p>

<p class="dir">
(<span class="dir">The Hama-dryads cease dancing and drift out of the window, followed
by the fawn. An English minister, once of St. Giles, Circenster, who
died in 1631, a monk of the Thebaid, A. D. 300, and three priests of Isis,
B. C. 2840, enter, each independently of the others. On detecting the odour
of reverence they visualize themselves to themselves as servitors of their
respective earthly religions—the Egyptians in their winged hoods, the monk
of the Thebaid in his high pointed cowl, the Rector of St. Giles in his
broad-brimmed hat with the high conical crown, knee-length coat, and
heavy, silver-buttoned shoes.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Minister</span> (<span class="dir">to himself</span>). An unhappy costume, yet it is all that
identifies me with my former earthly self, or with life. (<span class="dir">He notes the
Egyptians and the monk, but pays no attention to them for the moment</span>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">First Priest of Isis</span> (<span class="dir">to his brothers</span>). A house of worship. How the
awe of man persists. I thought I detected the rhythm of melody here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Second Priest</span> (<span class="dir">tall and severely garbed, yet in the rich colors of his
order</span>). And I. It is melody. I feel the waves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Third Priest</span> (<span class="dir">signing in the direction of the organist</span>). There is
the musician. He is arranging something. And here is a very present
reminder of one of our earthly stupidities. We worshiped the forerunner
of that in our day. (<span class="dir">He motions to the church cat who strolls by with
great dignity. They smile</span>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Cat</span> (<span class="dir">surveying them with indifferent eyes</span>). At least I am alive.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">First Priest</span> (<span class="dir">a master of astrology</span>). Small comfort. You will be
dead within the year. I see the rock that ends you. Then no more airs
for you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Monk of the Thebaid</span> (<span class="dir">to himself</span>). This is a religious edifice—heavily
material and of small pomp—christian, possibly. That spirit
yonder (<span class="dir">he surveys the minister of St. Giles</span>) was also a priest of sorts, I
take it, and these three Egyptians—how they strut! They give themselves <a id="corr-17"></a>airs
because of the thin memory of them and of their rites that endures in the
world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Minister of St. Giles</span> (<span class="dir">surveying the monk</span>). A sombre flagellant.
I wonder has he outgrown his earthly illusion. (<span class="dir">He approaches</span>).
Brother, do I not meet an emancipated spirit?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Monk.</span> You do. Centuries of observation have taught me what
earthly search could not. I smile at the folly of this. (<span class="dir">He waves an
inclusive hand about him</span>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Minister.</span> And I, I also—though I was of stern faith in my
day, and of this very creed—even now I suspect some discoverable power
worthy of worship. My mere persistence causes me to wonder though
it does not explain itself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Monk.</span> Nor does mine to me, nor the persistence of their seeming
reality to them. (<span class="dir">He points through the transparent walls of the church
to where outside moving streams of shadows—automobiles, belated wagons,
and pedestrians are to be seen—and to the lovers</span>). Yet there is no answer.
They have their faith, futile as it is. A greater darkness has fallen on you
and me. Endless persistence for us if we must, let us say, but merging
at last into what?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Minister.</span> And when I died I imagined I should meet my maker
face to face.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Monk</span> (<span class="dir">smiling</span>). And I the same. And they,—(<span class="dir">he nods toward
the Egyptians</span>),—their gods were as real to them,—shadows all, of the
unknowable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Organist</span> (<span class="dir">plunging into the sub-theme which speedily dies off
into unfathomable mysteries of dark notes and tones</span>). I wonder if I’m
boring them by this heavy stuff. Still what do I care. There are only
four. (<span class="dir">Nevertheless he fuses the Grail motif to the dance of the flower
maidens</span>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Boy.</span> Isn’t it lovely!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Girl.</span> Perfect!

rather stiffly,—and that automobile has to honk just now. (<span class="dir">He fingers
lightly three notes of a major key indicative of woodland echoes and faint
bird notes. Re-enter the barrel house bum who is seeking anything that
will amuse him</span>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Bum.</span> Still playing! And there are those two old stuffs of
women. Not an idea between ’em. (<span class="dir">He turns to go but catches sight of<em>

</em>the monk and the Egyptians. Pauses, and then turns back</span>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Monk.</span> Soothing harmonies these! More strange combinations,
the reason for which we cannot guess, the joy and beauty of which we
know. I find earthly harmonies very grateful. But then, why?

huh? Well, yuh got fooled didn’jah? You’re like all the other stuffs that

contemptuously</span>). You think you’re still a monk, don’cha? You think you’re
good—better’n anybody else. Whatcha got to be good about? Oh ho, ho,
ho, ho! Ah har, har, har, har! He thinks he’s still a monk—

Out, sot.

out? Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

<span class="smallcaps">The Organist</span> (<span class="dir">passing into the finale</span>). And this is even more beautiful.
It suggests graves and shrines—and fawns dancing. But I don’t

<p class="dir">
(<span class="dir">A troup of fawns and nymphs dance in, pursuing and eluding each
other. The six Hama-dryads return, weaving and turning in diaphanous
line. A passing cloud of hags and wastrels, the worst of the earth lovers,
enticed by the gaiety of sound, enter and fill the arches and the vacant
spaces for the moment, skipping about in wild hilarity. The Bum joins
them, dancing deliriously. Persistances of fish and birds and animals,
attracted by the rhythm which is both colour and harmony to them, turn
and weave among the others. Ancient and new dead of every clime, enamored
of the earth life and wandering idly, enter. A tired pedestrian of
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
forty, an architect, strolling for the air and hearing the melody, enters.
After him come spirits of the streets—a doctor and two artisans, newly
dead, wondering at the sound</span>).

I went the other night to an affair given by a Norwegian
woman and her husband before a gathering of Chicago’s representative
intellectuals. The woman was Borgny Hammer, an
actress of tremendous power from the National Theatre, Christiania.
Mme. Hammer plays Ibsen so well that there is not much chance
of her playing it very often. On this particular evening she gave
some Björnson things and talked with naive fervor of Norway as
compared with this commercialized land. Her intensity was so
authentic and so beautiful and so moving that it became almost
pitiable in that stiff, self-contained room. Mme. Hammer could be
playing <em>Ghosts</em> and <em>Master Builder</em> and <em>Beyond Human Power</em>,
could be giving nightly inspiration to thousands of unimaginative
Americans if America <a id="corr-22"></a>was able to offer the foreigner one tenth
of what the foreigner brings to America.

<p>
Not long ago the Hebrew Institute of Chicago refused its
platform to Alexander Berkman who was to speak there on the
Schmidt and Caplan case. Some one who sympathized with the
action of the directors explained to me that it was a wise move
on their part because the foreigners, especially the Russian Jews,
are so easily inflamed. Thank heaven they are! If only something
could be done to inflame the American. Well—there is
always the flag....

<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
The Illusions of “The Art Student”
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> has made its appearance in this city of ours a new magazine,
<em>The Art Student</em>. Its desire, according to the editor’s announcement,
is to “help establish a bond of understanding between the American student
of the allied arts and the public.”
</p>

<p>
This aim is commendable and deserves the co-operation of everybody
unselfishly interested in the promotion of American art.
</p>

<p>
The reason for this publication at the present time is also given in
that announcement. It says there: “With all Europe at war and its art
centers crippled, it is not only America’s opportunity, but her duty, to
preserve and promote art in its various forms.”
</p>

<p>
I am afraid the youthful enthusiasm of <em>The Art Student</em> is the cause
both of this exaggeration as concerns Europe and the illusion as concerns
America.
</p>

<p>
We have heard much and read more about America’s opportunity
these last fourteen months. First it was the trade fields deserted by the
warring nations in South America and the Orient; then it was the sea
routes closed to the second biggest merchant fleet of the world—the opportunity
for an American merchant marine; and now it is our opportunity
in the field of Art!
</p>

<p>
What has become of the first illusions of which our papers and magazines
were full? England expanded her commerce in South America,
having forced for the time being her German rival from that field of hottest
competition, and Japan practically monopolized the commerce of China.
England increases her merchant fleet by capering American ships, and the
Pacific Mail retires voluntarily from the Pacific ocean.
</p>

<p>
That is the result of our boasted opportunity in the realm of trade and
commerce. Why? Because we underestimated others and because we
talked about our own foreign methods instead of changing our own and
acting.
</p>

<p>
And now in Art we are doing exactly the same thing. We point with
horror to the war that cripples European art and acclaim loudly the superiority
of our civilization.
</p>

<p>
Gentlemen, you are all wrong. Art is not crippled in Europe through
the war! Inter arma silent musae! The arts are silent, they sleep.
Silence and sleep we all understand are good things. The first helps us
to concentrate and find ourselves, the latter gives us new strength.
</p>

<p>
And that is the worst that the war does to Art in Europe. Art is at
present less active, a self-imposed inactivity, owing to circumstances; not
crippled, a result of direct unartistic influences.
</p>

<p>
European Art is free of such crippling influences. Art schools are
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
not run by local millionaires, galleries not governed by rich manufacturers,
academy <a id="corr-23"></a>instructors not selected by wealthy trustees with the sole idea
that their insignificance will insure submittance to the layman rule!
</p>

<p>
Is Sir Thomas Lipton president of the Royal Academy? No! Is
Herr von Krupp president of the Duesseldorf Academy? No! Do they
make bankers and brewers <a id="corr-24"></a>directors and trustees of art institutions in
Paris or Munich? No! Do they in St. Petersburg or Vienna? No! Do
they in Berlin or Rome? No! Do they in Brussels or Madrid? No!
</p>

<p>
<em>Do they in America? Yes!</em>
</p>

<p>
Do they in England, France, Russia, Italy, Germany, or Australia
invite their best painters and sculptors to teach in their academies? Yes!
<em>Do they in America? No!</em> Do they in England, France, Russia, Italy,
Germany, or Austria select these teachers from mediocrities who will be
sure not to revolt against the incompetent decisions of a layman board of
trustees? They don’t!
</p>

<p>
<em>Do they in America? They do!</em>
</p>

<p>
What is “city beautiful” in Europe? It is a fact! <em>What is it in
America? It is a “slogan.”</em>
</p>

<p>
No, gentlemen, you need not be worried about European Art! War is
not inartistic. Money is! A general staff in war time can destroy what
art has created! Our system of millionaire trustees is preventing Art
from creating!
</p>

<p>
War in Europe can kill artists, it cannot kill art.
</p>

<p>
In America we kill art and our artists escape to Europe.

“Grotesques”
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">C</span><span class="postfirstchar">loyd</span> Head—Maurice Browne: comparatively misty names, far below
the golden monolith at whose base is carefully engraved the word—Granville
Barker. Mr. Barker resurrects Greek tragedies and Shakespeare
plays and produces them acceptably; Cloyd Head and Maurice Browne
have evolved an absolutely new stage method and draped it about a poetic
concept. Therefore Cloyd Head and Maurice Browne will probably be
heralded and worshipped ten years from now, at the earliest. They must
pay the penalty of originality and the ability of appreciating it.
</p>

<p>
In <em>Grotesques</em> recently produced at the Chicago Little Theatre, for the
first time, actors posed as black and white marionettes in a series of decorations
created by Fate, masquerading as a sardonic artist. The idea of
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
Fate moving human beings together as one shuffles a pack of cards is old.
But the portraying of this shuffling through conventional decorations with
the actors giving the jerking semblance of puppets, and with Fate personified,
directly addressing the audience, is sparklingly new. Capulchard, the
artist, has made a decoration symbolizing the background of life—an utterly
simple picture composed of a conventionalized black and white wave effect,
a black sky, a round white moon, stiff white trees, an owl on one of their
branches, and a lotus-flower. From his marionette boxes at both sides of
the decoration he drags forth his puppets—man motif, woman motif, crone
motif, sprite motif, girl motif, and carelessly waves them into various poses,
the main incidents of their lives. But they gradually become aware of
him, they begin to speak out of their lines, to burst into tiny rebellions
which he controls with difficulty. They show increasing determination to
mar his series of decorations. Finally in a moment of sublime defiance,
headed by the man-motif, they slash their strings. The result—Death.
Capulchard carelessly erases the decoration—it has served its purpose.
</p>

<p>
I shall probably fully drain <em>Grotesques</em> after slowly reading it again
and again. But even now, Cloyd Head’s huge child whose face is like
the pointed petals of sun-flowers, has aroused a little cluster of reactions
within me. To sharply visualise the play, you need not see the actual
black and white of the decoration, and the über-marionettes who move
stiffly through it. The words of the play themselves are black and white:
you feel them as an inextricable part of the picture: there is something in
their staccato rising and falling that suggests light and darkness evenly
spread upon a canvass. Something in the even placing and sounding of
phrases like this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Who am I that come,</p>
      <p class="verse">Caressing tenderly the sign of bird?</p>
      <p class="verse">A Girl, in white, alone, beside the pattern brook.</p>
      <p class="verse">I wander without fear, of fear not having heard.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
It is not easily explained. It is a feeling that can only come to one after
repeated reading of the play.
</p>

<p>
A second reaction comes to one while loitering with the images in
their jerking procession. Each image, with its absolute minimum of
words, has two clear virtues—the expression of emotion half-human and
half artificial, and the concentration of just enough of this emotion to
produce an illusion of the whole. Consider this speech of the sprite motif:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Tiptoe a-tread—thru the wood—by the brook—the sprite enters—oh, ho!</p>
      <p class="verse">Dance, crinkled stream!</p>
      <p class="verse">Ha; a dragon-fly poised upon air.</p>
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
      <p class="verse">(<em>Blows</em>) ... Begone.</p>
      <p class="verse">(<em>Reflectively</em>) It is night.</p>
      <p class="verse">(<em>Bowing</em>) Madame Owl.</p>
      <p class="verse">Hoot! To-whoo!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
An actual sprite-soul in life would babble, would use more extravagant
phrasing. In this sprite passage, just enough of the babbling and exuberance
has been given, to suggest the essence of it; just enough words have
been given, to suggest the steady motion of the invisible strings. These
qualities run throughout the speeches of all the über-marionettes.

<a id="PLAYS"></a><em>Plays for Small Stages, by Mary Aldis. New York: Duffield
and Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">hese</span> plays are among those acted by the Lake Forest Players, and,
written especially for them, they exemplify certain qualities of drama and
stage-craft which are of special value in amateur production. First of all
they are real in situation. Two of the five, <em>Mrs. Pat and the Law</em> and <em>Extreme
Unction</em>, deal with slum life, but with phases of it which the amateur
can study at first hand, and is, indeed, the better for studying. The juxtaposition
in both types of the submerged tenth and the reachers of helping
hands suggests that the plays have in fact, grown out of such study. The
former sketch is done with a brilliancy of Irish humor and fancy that reminds
the reader of Lady Gregory’s best. The latter is the grim tragedy
of a dying prostitute—a situation relieved first by the mordant irony of the
conventional religious pouncet-box of the well-meaning lady visitor, and
later by the sympathetic imagination of the physician. A third play, <em>The
Drama Class</em>, presents with broad humor an occasion familiar to all uplifters
of the drama in regions which on the “culture map” are lightly shaded—the
discussion of a modern European play by a woman’s club. <em>The Letter</em>
and <em>Temperament</em> represent the maladjustments of monogamy—the one
with tragic emphasis, the other in pure farce. The point should be noted,
however, that all five are plays of situation, static rather than dynamic, expository
and revealing rather than developing—the type most suited to the
dimensions of the one-act play, and made familiar by the playwrights of
the Abbey and Manchester Theatres. As Mrs. Aldis says in her preface,
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
speaking of the general policy of the Lake Forest Players: “In selecting
plays we have departed radically from the amateur tradition of resuscitating
‘plays with a punch,’ which have fared well in the hands of professionals.
In the established tricks of the trade, of course the amateur cannot
compete with the professional.” In writing as well as in selecting plays for
amateur performance Mrs. Aldis has wisely preferred truth of situation to
the “punch.”
</p>

<p>
In the second place Mrs. Aldis has made her characters speak the language
of life rather than that of the stage. This trait again fits her plays
for amateur production, especially in a small theatre where effects can be
gained without the emphasis of stage talk. Working as she says for a small
stage Mrs. Aldis has been able to reproduce with striking fidelity not only
the vocabulary but the movement, the rhythm, even the intonations of human
speech. This kind of naturalism is of great importance in the drama of
situation. The words in which Mrs. Aldis calls attention to this connection,
and to the possibilities of artistic success in amateur acting depending thereon
might have occurred in Maeterlinck’s essay <em>The Drama in Daily Life</em>.
“We seek,” she says, “plays in which the mental attitude and the interplay
of character are more important than the physical action. Here, if anywhere,
lies the amateur’s opportunity. So we are not afraid of plays with
little action and much talk.... It is in talk, low and intense, gay and
railing, bitter and despairing as the case may be, that we moderns carry
on the drama of life, the foundation of the drama of the stage.”

<a id="STATE"></a><em>The State Forbids: A Play in One Act, by

</p>

<p class="noindent">
The mother speaks: “The State won’t let us women help ourselves.
We <em>must</em> have children whether we want them or not, and then the State
comes and takes them from us. It doesn’t ask. It commands. We’ve got
to give them up. [<em>Shrilly</em>] I’ve got to give my boy. [<em>Again shrilly</em>] What
are we, we women? Just cattle. Breeding animals ... without a voice!
Dumb—powerless! Oh, the State! The State commands! and the State forbids!
Damn the State!”
</p>

<p>
It is to appear in vaudeville. Like <em>War-Brides</em> it is woman propaganda;
but here the emphasis is on Birth Control. Like <em>War-Brides</em> it is negative
as literature, but the woman speeches make smashing vaudeville. We wonder
whether it is the importance of its idea or its evident value as a thriller
and shocker which prompts its production.

<em>Ben Hecht, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
I congratulate you on the roseate misconceptions of “Life Itself.” Long live your
fancies—mine didn’t. The perfumes of Araby are short-lived in a slop-jar.
</p>

<p>
I envy you your dogmatic naïveté until I remember something I thought of long
ago:—that ideals are for the weak; that people who live on fancies starve for lack of
sorrow, shrivel for lack of cynicism, and finally die of inhibition.
</p>

<p>
I remember, in a discussion on art the other evening, your crying out about “the
eternal standard” and I feeling it was true but not knowing what it meant. I know
now. It meant nothing. It is just another fancy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="corr-27"></a>Vive la divinité!

<em>GOD’S GARDEN—THE WORLD</em>

<p class="note">
(<em>Yes, this still happens. We get hordes of such letters.</em>)
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I feel sure that at heart your idea of freedom is right, but I do not believe that
you altogether understand how to carry it out.
</p>

<p>
To get at the bottom of things—you want to be just a natural, normal human
being. You want to live, to grow, to expand like a flower. How then is this most
easily accomplished? Simply this, to be what nature or God or the power back of
the universe intended for you to be. What then is your place in the universe, and
what is your relation to it? You are by God’s grace a woman; then the greatest
thing you can do is to be a woman. But what does it mean to be a woman? To
love, to create, to protect, to uplift, and to purify. What do these words mean?
You can love the out-of-doors, you can love books, music, art, people, all the world,
everything your heart desires. All that you love you can create by writing, by making
things grow, by building and constructing. You can protect by being a mother to
all those weaker than yourself who need your help. You can uplift and purify by
inspiring all you meet with goodness and high ideals.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you say, but how can I be free to do these things when I am hampered
and bound by conventionalities and surroundings? No one is bound down who knows
that freedom comes from within, not from without. The girl in the factory, the girl
in college, the girl in her own home, or the girl out of doors can be just as free as
she makes up her mind to be. Freedom is not a matter of clothes or environment.
</p>

<p>
As to conventionalities—most of them have been formed because time and culture
have taught us to have regard for our fellow beings. There is nothing immorally
wrong in a man going to the opera in his shirt sleeves but it might not be agreeable
to the gentleman seated next to him. Then the psychology of the close relationship
between thoughts and actions—free thoughts result in free actions, likewise carelessness
in our habits of daily life make careless thinking. I believe in keeping your
own individuality above all things if you can back up your ideas by good reasons;
but you will find that there is a reason for most conventionalities that can’t be overthrown.
If we were not an integral part of a whole we could do just as we pleased
because no one would be affected and no one would care; but everything we do,
every move we make, affects some part of the whole, and that is why we care and
why everybody cares.
</p>

<p>
Stick to your idea of freedom and of being natural, but be careful how you
apply it and of its effect on others. Whatever is good and helpful will live and what
is not good will die.
</p>

<p>
Remember, too, that this is America, 1915, not Greece, B. C. 400.
</p>

<p>
Do not think I mean to be critical for I love you just the same as I love everybody
and all things in God’s garden, the world, so much so that I want you to fully
understand what it means to be a real woman.

THE PASSIONATE CRIME
</p>

<p class="ada">
By E. Temple Thurston
</p>

<p class="ads">
<em>Author of “The Open Window,” “The City of Beautiful Nonsense,” etc.</em>
</p>

<p>
A charming picture of old Ireland with its quaint superstitions, its mystery
and its romance. A traveler in Ireland comes across some exquisite
verses written by Anthony Sorel, a strange poet, and in his desire to learn
the life-story of the man the traveler finds a hidden history of love and
tragedy. It is the story of Anthony Sorel and Anna Quartermaine whose
romantic love and its woeful ending is ever the theme of the stories of
these simple country folk. With hushed voices they tell how Anthony’s
determination to seek the ideal life sent him away in fear lest he should
transgress in loving a woman of the world; of Anna’s love for him that
bade her follow him to his hut in the mountains, where they met at twilight.
Sorel believed her to be the fairy woman of his dreams and when he realized
that the woman before him was Anna he was maddened at his failure to
escape her charms and the terrible things that happened then haunt the
place forever like a banshee never at rest. But so beautifully is the Irish
country pictured, so carefully are the characters of the people drawn, that
the reader seems to live in a different world—the world of dreams come
true—peopled by men and women strangely endowed with intuitive understanding
and a love for and a strong faith in the influence of the mystic
world.

How do we do it? Here’s the answer: Gigantic
profits have been made from $25 machines because of
patent right monopoly. Millions have gone for advertising
$25 machines, and these millions came back
from the public. The attempt is to make $25 the standard price. It’s too much.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
